**Unit 5: U.S. Foreign Policy in Broad Perspective** <span
id="5"></span> 
*In this final unit, you will take a step back and consider how the
theoretical, historical, and topical information from previous units can
inform more general questions about formulating a grand strategy for
U.S. foreign policy that can inform decisions on specific issues.
Articulating a grand strategy requires that you first consider the goals
and values of U.S. foreign policy as well as the potential issues,
challenges, and decisions such a strategy is meant to inform and
influence. Doing so also requires that you think seriously about what
the future might hold for U.S. foreign policymakers. The purpose of this
unit is to help draw together the disparate elements of the previous
units: the overall themes, goals, and values relevant to foreign
policymakers in the United States.*
