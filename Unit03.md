**Unit 3: Major Periods in U.S. Foreign Policy** <span id="3"></span> 
*Karl Marx contended that “men make their own history, but they don’t
make it just as they please; they do not make it under circumstances
chosen by themselves, but under circumstances directly encountered,
given, and transmitted from the past.” This quote directs our attention
to the way in which history both informs and influences contemporary
issues in U.S. foreign policy. In this unit, you will learn about the
evolution of U.S. foreign policy from the early, post-revolution
administration of George Washington to the issues that currently face
President Obama. Employing a historical perspective shows us that while
leaders and decision makers are constrained by the decisions of their
predecessors, this simultaneously reinforces the idea that contemporary
decisions have lasting effects. Generally, tracing the history of U.S.
foreign policy shows how decision makers have influence on and are
influenced by the events in the world in which they live.   
    
 You will begin with the isolationist message President George
Washington articulated in his farewell address and move throughout U.S.
history to see the United States emerge as a global superpower following
the World War II. This unit will continue on to address how the United
States navigated the Cold War and how the strategic choices made during
this period provided the foundation and context for how contemporary
decision makers understand, define, and address present challenges.
Finally, you will consider how the United States has continued to shape
the world through its foreign policy as the lone superpower, following
the collapse of the Soviet Union and the historically-unique issues that
have emerged in a unipolar world.   
    
 As you move from each historical event and period, you should
continuously come back to the theories and concepts from the previous
unit to both understand how these theories can explain these historical
events as well as how these events influence the formulation of theory.
By tracing the broad history of U.S. foreign policy, you will develop an
understanding of not only specific historical events and eras, but the
values, goals, and concerns that shaped and emerged from them. *

     Instructions: While the United States has been a dominant world
    power for decades, it began as a much more humble player in the
    international system. George Washington’s farewell address, in which
    he warns the nascent country to avoid “foreign entanglements,”
    provides a useful way to understand how ideas about the best way for
    the United States to conduct its foreign policy have evolved
    considerably since its founding.

    of lecture notes.  
      
     U.S. involvement in the First World War was important with regard
    to the changing way in which U.S. foreign policymakers approaches
    the international system. In addition, an account of the politics
    and events leading up to the Great War in Europe provide a useful
    application of the concepts from international relations theory. As
    you read about the origins of World War I, consider concepts such as
    polarity and balancing.

    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: As stated above, Woodrow Wilson’s approach to the
    conduct of U.S. foreign policy exemplifies liberal principles of
    international relations, and his Fourteen Points speak to the
    importance of international institutions in fostering cooperation
    among nations.

    Germany”](http://bev.berkeley.edu/fp/readings/Wilson.txt) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Woodrow Wilson’s rationale for requesting a
    declaration of war on Germany employs ideas associated with liberal
    theories of international relations. His call to “make the world
    safe for democracy” evokes the democratic peace thesis, which as we
    saw in subunit 2.1.3, is a more contemporary argument in liberal
    theory. In addition, Wilson’s Fourteen Points speak to the
    importance of international institutions in preventing war in the
    future.

     You can also listen to the original recording of the speech by
    selecting one of the listening options before the text portion.
    Following the protracted trauma of World War I, there was a strong
    sentiment among policymakers and the public in the United States
    towards isolationism and an unwillingness to become involved in what
    Washington might have called “foreign entanglements.” This speech by
    Henry Cabot Lodge, advocating against the League of Nations, serves
    as a useful example of this sentiment.

    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: The interwar period was characterized by a global
    depression that made many countries, especially Germany, vulnerable
    to post-war nationalist fervor. This sentiment led to the embrace of
    autocratic rulers promising to restore their nations’ former glory.
    This material provides a chronological account of the rise of
    autocratic rule around the world during this time.

     Instructions: Scroll down to sessions 16-19 and click on the PDF
    link for “The Origins of the Second World War.” Study this set of
    lecture notes in its entirety.  
      
     Like World War I, World War II was an important event in the
    history and evolution of U.S. foreign policy and in the development
    of theories of international politics. Consider how concepts from
    such theories, especially realism, explain the origins of the Second
    World War. You should also carefully consider questions posed by
    other theoretical perspectives, such as the following: how did
    economic forces and processes create the conditions for world war?
    What role did non-material factors play: ideology, racism,
    victimization, isolationism, nationalism, and so on? Consider, for
    example, Professor Van Evera’s phrase that “Germans practiced
    creative history.” How important was this construction of history in
    convincing ordinary Germans of their innocence and the need for war?
    On this last question, consider the constructivist perspective.

    world power and had great influence on the construction of the
    post-war world. As you review the outline, keep in mind that it
    covers an immensely complex topic and raises even more complex
    questions about the origins, causes, and effects of the war. As you
    read, think carefully about how the questions posed in the outline
    might be answered from the realist, liberal, and constructivist
    perspectives.

     As World War II drew to a close, the political and economic leaders
    of the Allies held a series of conferences in which they envisioned
    the global institutions that would be established after the war.
    These institutions were intended to rebuild the countries ravaged by
    conflict and facilitate international coordination to prevent
    another global economic collapse and world war.

     This brief set of lecture notes provides a general overview of U.S.
    foreign policy issues since the Second World War that serves as a
    useful foundation for later readings and lectures that will delve
    more deeply into the topic. As you look through Professor Van
    Evera’s notes, you will see several references to “preventive” and
    “preemptive” war. There is an important distinction between these
    two terms. Preemptive war is a matter of striking shortly before an
    enemy is about to launch a strike of its own. A preventive attack,
    however, is not a response to an imminent threat, but is instead a
    means of precluding a hypothetical war sometime in the future. In
    international law, there is an important difference between
    preemption and prevention. Preemptive attacks are generally a
    permissible use of force, because they are seen as a form of
    self-defense. A preventive attack, on the other hand, is not usually
    seen as self-defense, but as an act of aggression.

     Instructions: Read this brief text.    
      
     Fear of Soviet and communist expansion during the Cold War and was
    motivated by the idea that if one country in a region fell to
    communism, then others would follow. This “falling dominoes” theory
    was first articulated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower during a
    press conference in 1954. Pay particular attention to the last part
    of Eisenhower’s response, in which he indicates that the primary
    reason for the defense of Indochina (the old name for Vietnam) was
    to protect Japan’s trading area. Consider the significance of this
    point. Why would the U.S. fight a war in Vietnam to protect Japan’s
    trading area? Why was the protection of Japan’s economic interests
    vital to American interests?

     Instructions: Read this text.    
      
     This is a background reading on the Cuban Missile Crisis, one of
    the most important events of the Cold War era. Earlier in this
    course, you read an article by Graham Allison on the crisis, which
    adopted a bureaucratic politics approach to explaining U.S. foreign
    policy decisions during the crisis. As you go through this reading,
    consider alternative explanations. For example, there is a realist
    “balance of power” argument that suggests the basis for the crisis
    was the alleged “missile gap” between the US and the USSR. What
    might a constructivist say about the differently constructed
    images/reality that each side of the conflict had regarding the
    other? Could the crisis have been prevented through cooperation, as
    liberal theory would suggest? There are many questions to consider
    as you go through this reading.

     The end of the Cold War was an unprecedented event for the
    international system, as the bipolar world order that characterized
    the Cold War yielded to a new global environment in which the United
    States became the world’s lone superpower. The United States sought
    to use this “unipolar” moment to shape the post-Cold War world. This

     Instructions: The end of the bipolar world order that characterized
    the end of the Cold War led many to inquire about what lines of
    division might spark armed conflict now that the battle between
    capitalism and communism had seemingly been decided. Here,
    Huntington makes the argument that in the future, conflict would be
    based on long standing divisions between what he calls
    “civilizations.” In light of the events that came after the
    publication of this essay (9/11, the war on terrorism, etc.), do you
    think Huntington’s argument is persuasive? Some have contended that
    this idea is a self-fulfilling prophecy (consider the constructivist
    argument). Does this sound plausible?

     Instructions: In the context of concerns about human rights, the

    of mass violence in the last half of the 20th century. This article
    also seeks to explain why the United States chose not to intervene.
    What is Power’s explanation? Where does it fit theoretically? Was
    the failure by the U.S. – and the rest of the international
    community, including the United Nations – a simple reflection of
    realist principles, or were there other important factors at play?
    Consider, on this point, the role of various domestic actors and the
    construction of language to justify non-intervention. The very use
    of the word “genocide” was subject to immense debate within the U.S.
    Why?

     Instructions: This speech articulates the approach the Bush
    administration took to foreign policy following 9/11. The speech
    lays out the Bush administration’s grand strategy, sometimes
    referred to as the Bush Doctrine, which was later re-articulated in
    the administration’s National Security Strategy. This strategy
    included the notion that the U.S. would engage in preemptive war to
    eliminate threats before they materialize, an argument used to
    justify the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
