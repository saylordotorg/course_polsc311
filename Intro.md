What is the best way to respond to global nuclear proliferation? Under
what circumstances should American soldiers be sent to war? How should
U.S. policymakers navigate a global economy? Will a global energy crisis
precipitate a third world war? How does history inform contemporary U.S.
foreign policymakers, and what issues will challenge future leaders?
Such questions can seem beyond the scope of an individual, but they are
questions that foreign policy decision makers in the United States must
confront. Further, the issues that such questions raise must also be
considered by members of the government bureaucracy and any citizen that
wishes to be an informed participant in American democracy. The
prominent role of the United States and a global leader makes examining
and understanding the actions that the U.S. takes toward the rest of the
world and how these decisions are made important for both American and
citizens of other nations alike. This course will provide history,
theory, and perspectives on current foreign policy issues to provide you
with a foundation for understanding the study of foreign policy and
perspectives to analyze a variety of pressing foreign policy issues. In
general, the foreign policy of the United States includes policy
decisions regarding international issues and relationships with foreign
countries. The phrase “politics stops at the water’s edge” alludes to
the way in which foreign policy issues are treated differently from
domestic issues in the study and conduct of American politics. While
there are many ways in which foreign policy is a unique policy area in
the context of politics and governance in the United States and
warranting separate study, it is nonetheless important to apply theories
of both domestic politics and international relations to understand and
analyze U.S. foreign policy. Towards these ends, this class will begin
by outlining the constitutional foundations of foreign policymaking in
the United States as well as the structure of and interplay between the
formal and informal institutions that craft and implement U.S. foreign
policy, including the president, Congress, the bureaucracy, the media,
and public opinion. Next, you will examine theories of international
relations that may inform and explain U.S. foreign policy as well as
specific theories of foreign policymaking to better understand the
decisions of policymakers as well as the outcomes of these decisions. In
order to fully understand contemporary issues in foreign policy, it is
important to study how the United States’ relationship with the world
has changed over time and how world events and U.S. foreign policy have
mutually influenced one another. Units 1-3 of this course provide this
overview. Towards these ends, you will gain an understanding of the
history of U.S. foreign policy and how American priorities and goals, as
well as the means of achieving them, influence foreign policy. In Unit
4, you will then address several issues relevant to current U.S.
policymakers in a manner that is informed by the previous units on the
foreign policymaking process, the theories used to understand these
processes, and historical perspective. In this regard, you will not only
consider the most pressing foreign policy issues of the day but also
understand how these issues have and will continue to change. For
example, the importance of traditional foreign policy issues such as
military security, war, and alliances; issues such as food and energy
security; environmental issues such as climate change; and human rights
have increasingly become part of the agenda of foreign policymakers. In
Unit 5, you will step back and consider U.S. foreign policy from a broad
perspective by considering issues of grand strategy and projects for the
future.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:

-   identify the processes and institutions relevant to foreign
    policymaking in the United States;
-   compare and contrast competing theories of international relations
    that relate to U.S. foreign policy as well as specific theories
    foreign policymaking, and explain how these theories help us
    understand U.S. foreign policy;
-   trace the historical development of U.S. foreign policy, including
    key historical events that have shaped and were shaped by U.S.
    foreign policy, and apply this historical context to contemporary
    issues in U.S. foreign policy;
-   list and describe substantive and geographical issues relevant to
    contemporary foreign policymakers in the United States, and provide
    informed policy proposals for addressing these issues;
-   synthesize information about U.S. foreign policy goals, values,
    contemporary issues, and trends to articulate a grand strategy for
    U.S. foreign policymakers to follow;
-   critically evaluate and analyze U.S. foreign policy goals, values,
    and contemporary issues using the conceptual and theoretical tools
    of the field. Explain how foreign policy goals and priorities have
    and will continue to change, and identify issues that will be
    important to future policymakers; and
-   apply theoretical principles from international relations and
    foreign policy analysis to explain and understand why the U.S.
    created and implemented specific foreign policy decisions.

**Requirements for Completion: **In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
Pay special attention to Units 1 and 2, as these lay the groundwork for
understanding the more advanced, exploratory material presented in the
later units. You will also need to complete the Final Exam.  
  
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through all of the resources in each unit.  
  
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
  
 **Time Commitment: **This course should take you approximately
**126.75** **hours **to complete. Each unit includes a “time advisory”
that lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.
These should help you plan your time accordingly. It may be useful to
take a look at these time advisories and to determine how much time you
have over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set
goals for yourself. For example, Unit 1 should take you 27.25 hours.
Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and decide to complete
subunits 1.1 and 1.2 (a total of 4.5 hours) on Monday night; subunit
1.3.1 (a total of 4.5 hours) on Tuesday night; subunit 1.3.2 (a total of
6 hours) on Wednesday and Thursday nights; etc.  
  
 **Tips/Suggestions: **This course is organized such that each unit
provides information on different aspects of U.S. foreign policy. Unit 1
focuses on how foreign policy is made in the U.S.; Unit 2 addresses
theories of foreign policymaking and international relations that help
us understand the decisions of leaders and the behavior of states in the
international system in a broad perspective; Unit 3 provides an overview
of U.S. foreign policy from the time of George Washington to the Obama
administration; Unit 4 addresses contemporary issues relevant to foreign
policymakers (as well as citizens) of the U.S.; Unit 5 looks to the
future role of the U.S. in the world. Be sure to consider how each unit
informs the others as well as the purpose of each unit. For example,
Unit 1 emphasizes discrete facts, such as the institutions and rules
that are relevant to foreign policymaking, while Unit 2 provides general
theoretical perspectives that can help you understand a wide range of
phenomena and should be kept in mind as you proceed through the
following units. The subunits of Unit 4 are in many ways discrete
issues, but they are surely connected by their relationship with one
another as well as the historical information found in Unit 3. In sum,
as you proceed through each unit, be sure to consider how they connect
with and inform one another.  
  
 Make sure to take comprehensive notes as you work through the resources
in each unit. These notes will serve as a useful review as you study and
prepare for the Final Exam.
