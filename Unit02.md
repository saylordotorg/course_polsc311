**Unit 2: Theories of International Relations and U.S. Foreign Policy**
<span id="2"></span> 
*Social science seeks to develop theories to help explain events in
history. Theories help provide lenses and frames of reference for
understanding events in the political and social world. Theories direct
our attention to specific aspects of politics and governance, highlight
issues that are important, and simplify reality. Employing theory to
political and social life allows us to diagnose problems, predict the
future, and propose solutions.  
  
 While foreign policy is more concrete and less theoretical than
international relations, employing theories of international politics
can help us to understand the conditions that influence foreign policy
decision makers. For example, realism provides a way to understand the
international system as anarchic, as well as concepts such as the
security dilemma and balancing reveal how policymakers might view the
world. In turn, you will consider how real world events might inform
these more general theories.  
  
 In addition to using theories to understand the context in which
foreign policy is made, you will learn about theories of the foreign
policy process itself. These theories more specifically consider how the
institutional context in which foreign policy is made can influence
specific decisions and who is empowered to make these decisions in the
first place. Theories of the foreign policy process help shed light on
what kind of information is available to foreign policymakers, what
goals these policymakers consider important, and why.*

     This article provides an overview of the three major theoretical
    approaches in international relations (IR) and foreign policy:
    realism, liberalism, and idealism (constructivism). The author also

     Instructions: Read this text.    
      
     Realism is the dominant theory of international politics and one of
    the most important theories to understand when studying U.S. foreign
    policy, given its emphasis on power politics. Some scholars that
    favor realist theories point to its timeless quality and ability to
    explain international relations in any time period. The Melian
    Dialogue, a small portion of Thucydides’ *History of the
    Peloponnesian Wars*, provides an illustration of realist principles
    and views of power politics. Whether or not you have heard of the
    Melian Dialogue before this class, you are likely familiar with its
    adage that summarizes realist thinking on international politics:
    “the strong do what they will while the weak suffer as they must.”

     Instructions: Watch this entire lecture. Having established the
    timeless nature and essential elements of realism through the Melian
    Dialogue, this lecture provides a more detailed and contemporary
    account of realist theory. Realism views the international system as
    anarchic (that is, there is no ultimate arbiter to settle disputes
    among states); it sees states as rational, unitary actors, and
    considers the distribution of power among states to be the most
    important component of international politics.

    Balance”](http://ocw.tufts.edu/Content/58/lecturenotes/726832) (HTML
    or PDF)  
      
     Instructions: One of the most important concepts in realist
    thinking is the idea of the “security dilemma,” which holds that
    states cannot ever really know the intentions of other states and
    are thus likely to perceive actions taken for defensive reasons as
    belligerent. This concept can help us understand how foreign
    policymakers perceive the actions of other states and can explain
    phenomena such as arms races. Clicking on the link above will take
    you to a page where you will see thumbnail pictures of Professor
    Taliaferro’s lecture slides. You can click on the first slide and

     Instructions: Read this article. It is critical to understand the
    difference between the contemporary usage of “liberal” in American
    politics with the traditional or classical use of the term, which is
    what Doyle and others refer to when they discuss liberalism. This
    article provides a more nuanced discussion of liberalism than the
    earlier article by Snyder. In particular, it highlights the
    distinctions within the liberal tradition, which are significant. As
    you read, consider the parallel between liberal internationalism and
    the democratic peace thesis. Keep these points in mind as you read
    the article.

     Instructions: An important assumption of realist thinking is the
    idea that the international system is anarchic. Anarchy means that
    there is no ultimate arbiter to resolve disputes among states;
    therefore, states must fend for themselves and try to accrue as much
    power as they can. Liberals do not necessarily disagree with this
    assumption, but they contend that states can mitigate the conditions
    of international anarchy by building institutions that facilitate
    cooperation between states. However, this still leaves many
    questions about how such institutions ought to be structured and
    their role in the international system. This lecture addresses these
    issues.

    the liberal tradition and foreign policymaking in the United States.
    The authors focus on how the Obama administration can develop a

    policy.”

     Instructions: Download this paper and read the article.    
      
     This article provides a useful application of constructivist
    principles to the specific relationship between the United States
    and China. The article also includes a basic and very brief summary
    of the constructivist framework, which focuses on “the role that
    ideas play in shaping actors’ identities and interests, and,
    consequently, actions.” This article also highlights the contrast
    between realist and liberal explanations of U.S.-China relations –
    in other words, this article helps to highlight the key differences
    among the major theoretical perspectives.

    and click on the link titled “Conceptual Models of the Cuban Missile
    Crisis” to view the PDF of Allison’s article.   
      
     Realism and liberalism tend to focus on larger processes, the
    “bigger picture.” However, many foreign policy analysts believe that
    an understanding of how foreign policies are actually made requires
    us to take a much closer look, literally going inside organizations
    to see how bureaucratic agencies and the people who run them
    interact to produce policy outcomes. Allison’s account of the Cuban
    Missile crisis is the most famous example of a study of the way in
    which bureaucratic structures, routines, and dynamics influence the
    way foreign policymakers respond to crises. As you read this
    article, consider how the outcome might have changed if the
    decision-making structure was different. As you do so, consider the
    earlier reading about the 9/11 Commission’s recommendations.

     This article provides an example of how the bureaucratic politics
    approach can be applied to the 9/11 attacks. The author focuses
    primarily on one agency, the FBI, and tells the story from the
    perspective of a single FBI agent. This article also provides a
    useful follow up to the 9/11 Commission Report.

     Instructions: Read this article.    
      
     In this paper, Kerbel draws from various constructivist accounts of
    how socially-constructed identities and interests shape the
    behaviors of actors on the international stage. He argues that
    cooperation between the U.S. and China is primarily explained by
    each country’s cultural, social, and historical identities; material
    considerations are secondary. Do you agree with this argument? Why
    or why not?

     Instructions: Watch this video.    
      
     While soft power is less of an approach to foreign policy and more
    of a concept, it has gained currency in policy circles.
    Understanding this concept is important for navigating contemporary
    debates about foreign policy.
