**Unit 1: Mechanics of Foreign Policy Formation in the United States**
<span id="1"></span> 
*In this unit, you will learn about the formal and informal institutions
that influence the foreign policymaking process in the United States.
Following a general overview of U.S. foreign policymaking, you will
learn about the constitutional roots of foreign policymaking in the
United States. While this discussion will overlap with more general
courses on American politics, it is important to understand how the
design of American government specifically influences foreign policy and
the process by which foreign policy is crafted and implemented.  
  
 After you understand how the design of American government influences
foreign policy, you will then delve more deeply into information about
the specific actors responsible for crafting and implementing foreign
policy for the United States, and how their roles differ. These actors
include constitutionally designated branches of government, such as the
president and Congress, but also the institutions that have developed
around them over time that make up the foreign policymaking bureaucracy,
such as the National Security Council and elements of the military
industrial complex. Finally, actors outside the government also play an
important role in influencing the decisions of foreign policymakers.
This unit will conclude by addressing additional domestic sources of
foreign policy such as the media, public opinion, and interest groups. *

     Instructions: Read this report. This reading provides a concrete
    overview of how the structure of U.S. foreign policymaking
    institutions influences the way U.S. foreign policy is formulated
    and carried out. These processes are strongly influenced by who is
    able to participate in them. In the United States, the Constitution
    affords the President, who is the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S.
    Armed Forces, significant foreign policy-making powers as well as
    control over a vast foreign policy-making bureaucracy in the
    executive branch. The chief executive has much more autonomy and
    authority to shape and carry out foreign as opposed to domestic
    policy. However, Congress also has important powers, especially in
    its budgetary and investigative authority. This reading also covers
    the topic outlined in subunit 1.2.2.  
      
     Reading this article should take approximately 30 minutes.

    individual chapter. Read Chapters 3, 6, and 13.  
      
     In the wake of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2011,
    policymakers in the United States sought to understand how these
    attacks could have been carried out without the knowledge the
    nation’s vast intelligence and law enforcement apparatus. The 9/11
    Commission studied the attack and considered how the government
    might be restructured to better share intelligence and to prevent
    similar attacks from happening in the future. Thus, the report
    provides an important contemporary example of the relationship
    between the structure of the U.S. foreign policymaking bureaucracy
    and the ability of the U.S. to achieve its foreign policy goals and
    protect its citizens. As you read, do not be overly concerned with
    details. The primary goal is get a sense of how foreign policymaking
    and foreign policy responses, especially to non-traditional threats,
    are part of a larger process and not just controlled by the
    President and Congress.

     In this address, President Eisenhower warned the nation about the
    dangers of what he termed the “military-industrial complex,” which
    was the web of interlocking relationships between Congress, the
    military establishment, and defense contractors that he contended
    exerted a strong influence on U.S. military policy and pushed for
    consistent increases in military spending. The sentiment was
    noteworthy, given Eisenhower’s background as a General in the U.S.
    Army and as Supreme Allied Commander during the Second World War.

     Instructions: Read this article.    
      
     This article provides a discussion about the role of interest
    groups and how they influence U.S. foreign policy through a detailed
    account of the Israel lobby. The authors also wrote a book about the
    influence of the pro-Israel Lobby on U.S. foreign policy and the
    detrimental effects of this influence on the decisions of U.S.
    policymakers. The article was met with a great deal of controversy,
    but has prompted a discussion among scholars and policymakers about
    the Israel lobby specifically and the role of interest groups in
    U.S. foreign policy generally. Keep in mind that while the authors
    are discussing a specific interest group focused on a particular
    foreign policy relationship, the principles they discuss can be
    applied across a variety of other relationships. Can you think of
    other outside interest groups – whether representing a foreign or
    domestic entity – that exercise the same or similar influence?
