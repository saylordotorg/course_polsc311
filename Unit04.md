**Unit 4: Contemporary Issues in U.S. Foreign Policy** <span
id="4"></span> 
*While the previous unit provided an overview of foreign policy issues
throughout American history that took you to the present, this unit will
build on this historical context to delve into the issues on the agenda
of contemporary decision-makers. In some cases, additional historical
information is required to understand these issues in depth, but your
focus will be on explicating the recent history and contemporary
dynamics associated with these topics.  
  
 As you move from issue to issue, it is important to consider the
specific nuances inherent in each topic that make choosing the best
course of action difficult for policymakers. At the same time, be sure
to step back and reflect upon how these specific issues complement and
influence one another, inform more broad theories of international
relations, and fit into more comprehensive historical narratives.  *

     Instructions: Click on the “Download Publication” link on the
    right-hand side of the page to view the article.  
      
     This article provides a good overview of energy issues from a
    policy perspective; the author presents his own argument, in which
    he suggests that “the security problems created by oil and gas
    import dependence will not be eliminated by government action.” His
    advice to national leaders “is to prepare to manage difficult
    crises, and perhaps even conflict, in the years ahead. It is most
    likely that the United States and other countries will remain
    dependent on oil and gas imports for many decades and will need to
    balance the security disadvantages with the economic advantages of
    international trade.” As you consider the author’s overall argument,
    think about different theoretical approaches to the issue of energy
    security. Are energy issues best addressed through a realist
    approach, in which military and political power is used to “ensure”
    continued access to energy resources? Or, is an approach that
    focuses on the construction of international regimes, cooperation,
    and stronger trading relationship a better path (the liberal
    approach)? How is the energy issue framed, and how does this framing
    shape policy choices and approaches?

     Instructions: This lecture addresses an important contemporary
    issue for U.S. foreign policymakers: Iran’s efforts to obtain a
    nuclear weapon. Reese begins with a general overview, covering some
    of the topics discussed in the first reading, including the United
    States’ decision to overthrow Iran’s first democratically-elected
    government. Reese also provides a somewhat critical view of U.S.
    foreign policy, and raises the question: is a nuclear Iran really a
    threat to the U.S. and its allies, including Israel? Is Iran an
    existential threat? How does Reese answer this question, and what
    are the theoretical implications of his answer?

     Instructions: Watch this discussion which focuses primarily on
    developments within China over the past few decades.    
      
     This video also touches on foreign policy issues between the United
    States and China. These issues are of utmost importance to U.S.
    foreign policymakers, given that rivalry between the U.S. and China
    will shape the international system for the foreseeable future. As
    you watch this video, think carefully about the implications of
    China’s economic development, its growing prominence in the global
    economy as both a major source of and destination trade and
    investment, and its increasingly strong economic links with the
    United States in particular. Do these economic factors matter?
    Should U.S. foreign policy attempt to strengthen economic links with
    China and encourage Chinese industrial growth? Or, should the U.S.
    be wary of China’s growing economic might?

    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read this article.    
      
     This is a theoretically-oriented discussion on the state and future
    of U.S.-China relations. Friedberg examines “liberal optimists,” who
    focus on economic interdependence, international institutions, and
    democratization; “realist pessimists,” who stress a shifting balance
    of power and the expansionists aims of China; “realist optimists,”
    who see strict limits to Chinese power and ambitions; and “liberal
    pessimists,” who focus on the effects of authoritarianism in China
    and the crusading nature of U.S. foreign policy. He also provides a
    similar binary discussion of “constructivist optimists” and
    “constructivist pessimists.” How does the author resolve the
    differences among all these perspectives? Or, does he resolve them?

     Instructions: Read this webpage.    
      
     This reading on the Eurozone and the current economic crisis does
    not focus on U.S. foreign policy per se, but it raises important
    questions about what the United States’ role in the crisis should
    be, if any. As you read about the issue, consider how the issue
    would be interpreted from a realist, liberal, and constructivist
    perspective. What are the “dangers”? What are the solutions? How
    should the crisis be framed or understood? The article itself is
    brief, but you should spend time thinking about how to apply the
    various theoretical principles to evaluating the Eurozone crisis
    from the standpoint of US foreign policy.

     There are several topics we could focus on in a discussion of
    U.S.-European relations, and one underlying foreign policy issue is
    the conflict values between the United States and the European
    Union. This paper was written during the Bush administration, when
    the value conflict was particularly salient. How are U.S.-EU
    relations different or similar under the Obama administration, in
    which there is supposedly a better alignment of values? Do values
    really matter? If so, what are the theoretical implications of
    saying so? Think about these questions as you complete the
    reading.

     Instructions: Read this article. Written by one of the field’s
    leading scholars, this article provides a theoretically-oriented
    discussion on the question of nuclear proliferation. The article, we
    should note, is not specifically about U.S. foreign policy, but the
    underlying argument is nonetheless quite relevant. That is,
    understanding why “states build nuclear weapons” is absolutely
    crucial to developing a sound foreign policy on nuclear
    proliferation/non-proliferation. As you read the article, keep in
    mind what a sound policy would be under the different models. Also,
    consider which model makes the most sense, and which model, if any,
    the author subscribes to.
